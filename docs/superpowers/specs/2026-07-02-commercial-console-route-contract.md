# OPL Cloud Commercial Console Route Contract

## Brief

Use Product Design to rebuild OPL Cloud as a commercial console, not a demo page. The UI must be clean, visual, and sparse: less explanatory copy, more status, tables, actions, and focused empty states.

The implementation stays on `feature/user-resource-billing`. Main must remain untouched.

## Route Contract

Public and auth routes:

```text

```

## Menu Contract

Lab Owner primary menu:

```text
Overview
Workspaces
Gateway
Billing
Account & Lab
Support
Alerts
```

Admin adds:

```text
Admin Overview
Users
Governance
All Workspaces
Billing Ops
Gateway Ops
Fabric
Ledger
Runtime
Support Ops
Audit
Settings
```

Do not expose these in the Lab Owner primary menu:

```text
Raw Ledger events
Runtime evidence
Production readiness
TKE/K8s
Manual settlement
Request fingerprints
Dedup rows
Manual top-up execution
```

## Interaction Contract

- All primary routes must be clickable and restore on refresh.
- Use lazy-loaded route components.
- Route metadata must include role visibility, menu visibility, and feature-gate intent.
- Workspaces must make URL copy/open/reset/delete visible as row or detail actions.
- Create Workspace must use a stepped confirmation flow with package, price, seven-day hold, and balance sufficiency.
- Billing must explain wallet, holds, usage, and recent charges without dumping raw Ledger data.
- Manual top-up is executed from `Users -> User detail -> Wallet`; top-up records are viewed from Billing Ops.
- Support tickets must support list, new ticket, and detail views.

## Product Design Rules

- Commercial UI, not demo UI.
- Sparse copy. Prefer cards, tables, status tags, timelines, and direct actions.
- Avoid dense walls of panels.
- Keep Lab Owner focused on Workspace delivery and billing clarity.
- Keep operator evidence in Admin only.
- Use Ant Design and ProComponents on React + Vite.
- Follow Sub2API's route/auth/admin separation, not its Vue stack.

## Test Contract

Replace the legacy Chinese IA lock test with route and permission contract tests:

- route contract includes public, auth, console, support, and admin routes;
- Lab Owner menu excludes admin/runtime/raw ledger/manual top-up internals;
- Admin menu includes users, wallet top-up, audit, runtime, Fabric, Ledger, and support ops;
- support ticket routes exist;
- commercial UI source does not expose `结算 1 小时`, `requestUsageDedup`, `requestFingerprint`, or `production readiness` in Lab Owner route definitions.
