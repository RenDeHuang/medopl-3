- full OPL Gateway product surface;
- standalone OPL Ledger service;
- standalone OPL Fabric service;

- connector/environment/agent marketplaces.

## Product Gaps

- External payment settlement.
- GPU Workspace package.
- Full OPL Gateway key and quota product surface.
- Standalone OPL Fabric and OPL Ledger services.
- Connector, environment, and agent marketplaces beyond approved catalog shells.

## Repository Hygiene Rules

- Active docs describe current truth only.
- Machine contracts live in `packages/contracts/**`.
- Tests should read contracts or runtime outputs where possible.
- Temporary cleanup guards need an owner and removal condition.

## Required Verification

Before claiming a development branch is complete:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
git diff --check
```
