# OPL Cloud Seven-Phase Implementation Plan

This plan tracks the v1 business chain:

```text
PI opens OPL Console
-> creates an OPL Workspace
-> OPL Cloud creates one server, one cloud disk, one one-person-lab-app Docker runtime, and one URL
-> PI shares the URL
-> members enter the OPL Workspace without login
-> OPL Console manages lifecycle, billing, and audit
```

Development discipline follows the One Person Lab style: small durable contracts, focused diffs, no phase-only smoke artifacts in git, and machine-readable behavior tests instead of prose assertions.

## Phase 1: Product and Local Runtime Loop

Status: implemented.

Delivered:

- OPL Cloud, OPL Console, and OPL Workspace naming.
- Product design freeze in `PRODUCT_DESIGN.md`.
- Console UI for Workspace creation, URL access, server/disk lifecycle, billing, and audit.
- Local Docker provider that writes real Docker Compose runtime artifacts under ignored `.runtime/workspaces`.
- Optional local execution with `OPL_LOCAL_DOCKER_EXECUTE=1`.
- Permanent URL token and no-login Workspace access rule.
- Server and disk lifecycle separation.
- 7-day storage pre-freeze.

Durable checks:

- `tests/workspace-lifecycle.test.js`
- `tests/local-docker-provider.test.js`
- `tests/workspace-url-route.test.js`

## Phase 2: Tencent IaC Scaffold

Status: implemented.

Delivered:

- OpenTofu scaffold in `infra/tencent-cvm`.
- Tencent CVM server resource.
- Tencent CBS cloud disk resource.
- Server and disk attachment.
- Cloud-init bootstrapping.
- Ansible deployment for Docker Compose, Caddy route, and `one-person-lab-app`.
- Sensitive Workspace URL output.

Durable checks:

- `tofu init -backend=false -input=false`
- `tofu validate`

Cleanup rule:

- Remove `infra/tencent-cvm/.terraform/` after validation.
- Do not commit `.terraform/`, tfstate, plan files, or cloud credentials.

## Phase 3: Real Tencent CVM Workspace Creation

Status: active.

Delivered:

- `tencent-cvm` runtime provider selectable with `OPL_RUNTIME_PROVIDER=tencent-cvm`.
- Provider runs `tofu init`, `tofu apply`, `tofu output -json`, and `ansible-playbook`.
- Provider maps server ID, disk ID, public IP, Docker image, URL, and disk mount back into the OPL Workspace record.
- Provider fails closed until required Tencent environment and tools are present.
- Provider exposes readiness data through `GET /api/runtime/readiness`.
- OpenTofu state is isolated per Workspace under ignored `.runtime/tencent-cvm/<workspaceId>/`.

Required environment:

```text
TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID
TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY
TENCENTCLOUD_REGION
OPL_WORKSPACE_DOMAIN
OPL_VPC_ID
OPL_SUBNET_ID
OPL_SECURITY_GROUP_ID
OPL_AVAILABILITY_ZONE
OPL_IMAGE_ID
OPL_SSH_KEY_ID
OPL_WORKSPACE_IMAGE
```

Required tools on the API host:

```text
tofu
ansible-playbook
tccli
```

Next real-cloud verification:

1. Inject the environment through shell env, CI secrets, or a deployment secret manager.
2. Start API with `OPL_RUNTIME_PROVIDER=tencent-cvm`.
3. Open OPL Console and confirm runtime readiness is ready.
4. Credit the PI account.
5. Create one Basic Workspace.
6. Verify Tencent creates one CVM, one CBS disk, one Docker runtime, and one URL.
7. Verify the URL reaches the OPL WebUI and the disk is mounted to `/data`.

Do not copy secret files from older projects into this repo.

## Phase 4: Cloud Lifecycle Controls

Status: implemented at the Tencent CLI command boundary; real Tencent account verification is pending environment injection.

Goal:

- Stop server billing without destroying CBS storage.
- Restart or recreate the server while preserving the disk, token, and URL.
- Destroy the server while retaining disk.
- Destroy the disk only after explicit data-loss confirmation.

Delivered:

- `stopServer` runs `tccli cvm StopInstances --StoppedMode STOP_CHARGING` and keeps CBS storage active.
- `restartServer` runs `tccli cvm StartInstances` for stopped servers and preserves the Workspace URL/token.
- `recreateServer` runs `tccli cvm RunInstances`, attaches the retained CBS disk, describes the new public IP, then reruns Ansible when the previous server was destroyed.
- `destroyServer` stops the CVM if needed, detaches CBS storage, then runs `tccli cvm TerminateInstances`.
- `destroyDisk` is the only action that runs `tccli cbs TerminateDisks`.
- `destroyDisk` first releases server compute when a user destroys storage from a running Workspace, then destroys the retained disk.
- Tests assert that server lifecycle actions never call disk termination.

Next real-cloud verification:

1. Inject Tencent env and make `tccli` available on the API host.
2. Create a real Tencent Workspace.
3. Stop server and verify server billing status stops while CBS remains billable and retained.
4. Restart server and verify URL/token still point to the Workspace.
5. Destroy server and verify CBS remains detached and billable.
6. Restart the server-destroyed Workspace and verify Tencent creates a new CVM, attaches the retained CBS disk, reruns Ansible, and keeps the same URL/token.
7. Destroy disk explicitly and verify storage billing stops.

## Phase 5: PostgreSQL Persistence

Status: implemented and verified against a temporary real PostgreSQL container.

Goal:

- Replace JSON file state with PostgreSQL as the durable control-plane database.
- Keep JSON store only for local development if useful.

Tables to introduce:

- `accounts`
- `workspaces`
- `billing_ledger`
- `audit_events`
- `runtime_operations`

Delivered:

- `PostgresStore` uses the same store interface as local JSON storage.
- API selects PostgreSQL automatically when `DATABASE_URL` is configured.
- Schema creation is owned by the API startup path.
- Accounts, Workspaces, billing ledger entries, and audit events persist to dedicated PostgreSQL tables with JSONB state payloads.
- `runtime_operations` persists runtime operation attempts for create, stop, restart, server destroy, and disk destroy.
- Failed runtime provider calls are recorded as failed operations for retry and audit.

Requirements:

- Workspace state must survive API restart.
- Workspace URL/token state must remain stable.
- Runtime operations should be auditable and retry-aware.

Verification:

1. `tests/postgres-store.test.js` verifies the table contract and transaction path.
2. A temporary `postgres:16-alpine` container verified real `PostgresStore` read/write behavior.
3. The temporary container and files are removed after verification.

Next production step:

- Provide a managed production `DATABASE_URL` and run the same create/restart/readback workflow against the deployed API.

## Phase 6: OpenMeter Metering

Status: implemented at the event sink boundary.

Goal:

- Send server runtime and storage usage events to OpenMeter.
- Keep OPL Console ledger as the product billing truth for v1.
- Keep Lago for later invoice or subscription workflows.

Event families:

- `workspace.server.running_hours`
- `workspace.storage.gb_hours`
- `workspace.storage.hold`
- `workspace.lifecycle.action`

Delivered:

- `OpenMeterClient` posts CloudEvents-style JSON usage events to `OPENMETER_ENDPOINT`.
- API enables OpenMeter only when both `OPENMETER_ENDPOINT` and `OPENMETER_API_KEY` are configured.
- `openMeterDefinitions()` declares the production meter definitions for server running hours and storage GB-hours.
- Billing settlement emits:
  - `workspace.server.running_hours`
  - `workspace.storage.gb_hours`
- OpenMeter rejection fails the settlement request instead of silently splitting ledger and usage events.
- `npm run reconcile:tencent` compares OPL ledger debits to Tencent bill totals plus the 10% markup and fails non-zero on mismatches.
- `npm run reconcile:tencent -- --console-origin <url> --account <id>` reads the OPL ledger from a deployed OPL Console state endpoint, so production reconciliation does not require a temporary `ledger.json` file in the repository.
- `npm run reconcile:tencent -- --tencent-format raw` normalizes Tencent billing export rows when they carry a `workspace_id` tag.

Not yet delivered:

- OpenMeter dashboards.
- Lago invoice/subscription integration.
- Direct Tencent billing API download. The current reconciliation boundary accepts normalized JSON or raw exported rows and can pair them with the live deployed OPL Console ledger.

Billing rules remain:

- Hourly server billing.
- Storage billing until disk destruction.
- Tencent cost plus 10% platform markup.
- 7-day storage pre-freeze before opening or resuming.

## Phase 7: Production Hardening

Status: partially implemented; production readiness gate and runbook are in place, while real launch verification is pending production environment injection.

Goal:

- Use Harbor as the production image registry.
- Use Caddy for HTTPS Workspace URL routing.
- Move secrets into a deployment secret manager.
- Add audit/recovery runbooks.
- Add cloud cost reconciliation against Tencent billing.

Delivered:

- `GET /api/production/readiness` checks production provider, Harbor image, workspace domain, PostgreSQL, OpenMeter, Tencent env, and required host tools.
- Production readiness requires `OPL_WORKSPACE_IMAGE` to come from the configured `OPL_HARBOR_REGISTRY`.
- Production readiness also enforces the `one-person-lab-app` Docker/WebUI contract: port `3000`, persistent `/data`, and persistent `/projects`.
- OPL Console displays production launch blockers.
- `deploy/production-manifest.example.json` defines the production secretRef handoff contract.
- `npm run validate:production-manifest` validates required launch variables and fails if sensitive values are inlined.
- `npm run verify:production` runs the deployed API business-chain verifier without writing smoke artifacts to the repo.
- The production verifier appends a unique run id to the default verification Workspace name, preventing repeated runs from reusing a previously destroyed Workspace record.
- The production verifier also includes the run id in credit and billing settlement source event ids, making verification ledger entries traceable during reconciliation.
- The production verifier now destroys its verification server and disk after the lifecycle and billing checks complete, reducing the chance of validation resources continuing to bill after a successful run.
- If the production verifier fails after Workspace creation, it still attempts verification server and disk cleanup before returning the original failure, and attaches cleanup errors for operator recovery.
- The production verifier CLI emits structured JSON on both success and failure, so deployment records can capture `cleanupErrors` without writing smoke files into the repo.
- `npm run reconcile:tencent` provides the Tencent bill reconciliation gate for deployment records without writing smoke artifacts to the repo.
- `docs/PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md` defines launch, recovery, and artifact hygiene checks.
- Tencent Ansible installs Caddy, imports Workspace routes from `/etc/caddy/conf.d/*.caddy`, and fails deployment when the token-gated route cannot reload.
- Tencent Ansible mounts the attached CBS data disk at `/data/opl` before starting the `one-person-lab-app` Docker runtime, then maps `/data/opl/data` to `/data` and `/data/opl/projects` to `/projects`.

Hardening requirements:

- No committed secrets.
- No public no-auth container without token gateway or trusted proxy boundary.
- No untracked runtime artifacts left in the repo after verification.
- Workspace URL contains a permanent owner-controlled token until reset or deletion.

## Current Blocker For Real Phase 3

The repository is ready to attempt real Tencent creation once the required Tencent environment variables are injected. Without those values, `tencent-cvm` intentionally reports readiness gaps and refuses to create cloud resources.
