# OPL Cloud Implementation Goal Ledger

This repository is the OPL Cloud implementation workspace for the OPL Console and OPL Workspace control-plane slice.

## Product Truth

[`one-person-lab-cloud`](https://github.com/gaofeng21cn/one-person-lab-cloud) owns the Cloud product definition and fixed product layers:

- OPL Gateway
- OPL Workspace
- OPL Console
- OPL Fabric
- OPL Ledger

This repository currently implements the OPL Console / OPL Workspace control plane, with early OPL Fabric and OPL Ledger boundaries. The production-shaped deployment target is Tencent TKE.

## Development Truth

[`one-person-lab`](https://github.com/gaofeng21cn/one-person-lab) owns the development framework concepts. Work here is organized by:

- goal
- attempt
- readiness
- receipt
- blocker
- next step
- human gate
- recovery
- evidence

The repository should not accumulate phase-only smoke files, temporary reports, or broad staged narratives that outlive the actual implementation evidence.

## Goal

Support this business chain:

```text
PI signs in to OPL Console
-> creates an OPL Workspace
-> OPL Cloud creates one workspace runtime compute unit, one persistent workspace storage volume, one one-person-lab-app runtime container, and one URL
-> PI shares the URL
-> members enter the OPL Workspace without login
-> OPL Console manages lifecycle, billing, audit, readiness, recovery, and evidence
```

Resource invariant:

```text
1 OPL Workspace
= 1 runtime compute unit
= 1 one-person-lab-app runtime container
= 1 persistent workspace storage volume
= 1 URL
```

Compute and storage lifecycles stay separate. Stopping or recreating compute must not destroy workspace storage. Storage destruction is explicit and is the only action that stops storage billing.

Storage backup invariant:

```text
Workspace storage backup
= 1 Kubernetes VolumeSnapshot of the retained Workspace PVC

Workspace restore
= 1 new billable Workspace
= 1 new PVC restored from the selected VolumeSnapshot
```

Retention pruning deletes only backup snapshots. It must not delete source PVCs, restored PVCs, runtime compute, Services, Ingress routes, or Workspace access tokens.

## Current Attempts And Receipts

### Console And Workspace Control Plane

Attempt:

- Implement the PI-facing OPL Console for workspace distribution.
- Keep Workspace URLs token-gated and usable without member login.
- Preserve one PI account to many Workspaces.

Receipts:

- `packages/console/ui/main.jsx`
- `packages/console/src/opl-cloud.js`
- `tests/domain/workspace-lifecycle.test.js`
- `tests/domain/workspace-url-route.test.js`
- `packages/contracts/opl-cloud-product-contract.json`
- `packages/contracts/opl-cloud-workspace-lifecycle-contract.json`

### OPL Fabric Runtime Providers

Attempt:

- Keep Local Docker as the local runtime loop.
- Keep Tencent TKE as the production runtime provider.
- Keep Fabric resource catalog ownership in `packages/fabric`, with Console opening only `available=true` Workspace packages.
- Hand off cloud provisioning through TKE, TCR, Kubernetes Ingress, and persistent workspace storage.
- Hand off retained Workspace storage backup and restore through TKE/CBS `VolumeSnapshot` and PVC `dataSource` contracts.
- Keep GPU packages unavailable until a GPU node pool is verified.

- `tests/providers/server-provider-config.test.js`

### OPL Ledger And Evidence

Attempt:

- Keep OPL Console as the v1 billing truth.
- Keep OPL Ledger as the v1 billing truth with prepaid compute/storage holds, hourly internal debits from available balance first, frozen-hold consumption after balance exhaustion, hold release, and auto-stop/freeze receipts.
- Preserve operation attempts, billing ledger entries, evidence receipts, audit events, notifications, verifier output, and Tencent bill reconciliation reports.
- Store the latest Tencent bill reconciliation guard in Console state and fail closed for new Workspace provisioning when OPL debits do not cover Tencent cost plus markup.
- Keep control-plane receipts for Workspace lifecycle actions.
- Add task evidence receipt v1 as a Ledger-owned baseline for plan, approval, environment, input refs, execution refs, output refs, review results, and continuation.
- Keep domain reviewer authority, artifact storage, and agent run registry out of this repository.

Receipts:

- `packages/ledger/src/evidence-ledger.js`
- `packages/ledger/src/task-evidence.js`

- `tests/persistence/postgres-store.test.js`
- `tests/production/production-verifier.test.js`

### Production Readiness And Handoff

Attempt:

- Fail closed until production runtime provider, registry images, workspace domain, PostgreSQL, Tencent environment, and required host tools are ready.
- Validate the production manifest without leaking secrets.
- Keep real cloud verification behind an operator-controlled human gate.

Receipts:

- `packages/console/src/production-readiness.js`
- `packages/console/src/production-manifest.js`
- `deploy/production-manifest.example.json`
- `docs/PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md`

- `tests/production/production-readiness.test.js`
- `tests/production/production-manifest.test.js`
- `tests/production/production-manifest-cli.test.js`

## Readiness Gates

Local readiness:

```text
GET /api/runtime/readiness
```

Production readiness:

```text
GET /api/production/readiness
```

Manifest readiness:

```bash
npm run validate:production-manifest -- --manifest deploy/production-manifest.example.json
```

Structural readiness:

```bash
sentrux check .
```

Development verification:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
```

## Human Gates

The following actions require explicit human approval before execution:

- Renaming the GitHub repository.
- Renaming the local folder.
- Running `npm run verify:production`.
- Creating real Workspace runtime resources, storage, DNS, or billing side effects outside the documented production deploy workflow.
- Injecting or confirming production secrets.

## Current Production Evidence

The OPL Cloud TKE production entrypoint is deployed and externally reachable.

Verified production inputs:

- `OPL_CLOUD_IMAGE=uswccr.ccs.tencentyun.com/oplcloud/opl-cloud:fc1609074f2e`
- `OPL_WORKSPACE_IMAGE=uswccr.ccs.tencentyun.com/oplcloud/one-person-lab-app:latest`
- `OPL_RUNTIME_PROVIDER=tencent-tke`
- `OPL_PUBLIC_URL=https://cloud.medopl.cn`
- `OPL_CONSOLE_DOMAIN=cloud.medopl.cn`
- `OPL_WORKSPACE_DOMAIN=workspace.medopl.cn`
- `OPL_WORKSPACE_STORAGE_CLASS=cbs`
- `OPL_K8S_NAMESPACE=opl-cloud`
- `OPL_IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_NAME=tcr-pull-secret`
- The v22 TKE cluster is the OPL Cloud production cluster.
- The v22 TCR registry/namespace continues to serve OPL Cloud.
- The v22 kubeconfig is allowed for OPL Cloud deploy.
- The v22 PostgreSQL service is allowed for OPL Cloud control-plane and ledger persistence.
- TLS is installed through Tencent qcloud certificate-id Secrets:
  - `opl-cloud-console-medopl-cn-tls`
  - `opl-cloud-workspace-medopl-cn-tls`
- `cloud.medopl.cn` and `workspace.medopl.cn` both point at the OPL Cloud TKE Ingress CLB.
- The TKE Ingress uses `ingress.cloud.tencent.com/direct-access: "true"` so HTTPS traffic reaches the pod backend.

Verified external entrypoints:

- `https://cloud.medopl.cn/api/state` returns HTTP 200.
- `https://cloud.medopl.cn/api/production/readiness` returns HTTP 200 with `ready: true`.
- `https://workspace.medopl.cn/` returns HTTP 200.

Verified production Workspace lifecycle:

- Run id: `20260702T001006Z-pilot-gaps`.
- Verification Workspace: `ws-9w6zwy`.
- Receipt path: `.runtime/verification/20260702T001006Z-pilot-gaps.stdout.json` (ignored, not committed).
- Result: `ok: true`.
- Runtime status passed on first attempt:
  - `deployment_ready`
  - `workspace_image_pulled`
  - `pvc_bound`
  - `deployment_uses_retained_pvc`
  - `service_targets_workspace`
  - `service_endpoints_ready`
  - `ingress_routes_workspace_url`
- Workspace URL opened on first attempt before and after compute recreation.
- Lifecycle checks passed:
  - stop compute while retaining storage
  - restart compute
  - destroy compute while retaining storage
  - recreate compute from retained storage
  - settle billing
  - destroy verification compute
  - destroy verification storage
- Cleanup errors: none.
- Console state after cleanup: `state=destroyed`, `server.billingStatus=stopped`, `disk.billingStatus=stopped`, `access.tokenStatus=unavailable`, `account.frozen=0`.
- Previous successful run: `20260701T234830Z-console-decoupling`.

Do not print secret values. Do not commit `.env.production*` or `.env.preproduction*` files.

## Current Pilot Gate

Use [CONTROLLED_PILOT_CHECKLIST.md](./CONTROLLED_PILOT_CHECKLIST.md) as the current pilot gate. The OPL Console control-plane should not claim public GA or full OPL Cloud completeness until payment settlement, Gateway product surface, full Ledger service boundaries, and richer Fabric resource catalog boundaries are separately closed.
