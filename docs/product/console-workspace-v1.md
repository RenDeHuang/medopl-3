# OPL Console Workspace Product V1

## Target User

Target users are Lab Owners and administrators who create, fund, operate, and distribute OPL Workspace URL entries backed by independently purchased compute and storage resources.

The primary Lab Owner job is:

```text
sign in -> open compute allocation -> open or select storage -> attach storage -> create Workspace URL -> copy URL -> share URL with members
```

OPL Workspace is the stable URL entry and lifecycle record. The running application is a runtime template image deployed behind that URL. The default runtime template is `one-person-lab-app`, but that image is not a billing object and does not own the Workspace, compute allocation, storage volume, or attachment.

## Lab Owner Surface

Lab Owner sees:

- Workspace list.
- Workspace URL copy, open, reset, and delete.
- Workspace URL state and runtime readiness.
- Package, ComputePool, ComputeAllocation state, storage state, hourly estimate, and seven-day hold estimate.
- Compute creation flow: package, hourly price, hold, balance sufficiency, provisioning status, and failure details.
- Storage creation flow: capacity, GB-month price, hourly estimate, hold, balance sufficiency, provisioning status, and failure details.
- Attachment flow: selected compute allocation, selected storage volume, mount path, runtime template, and Workspace URL behavior.
- Billing: balance, frozen amount, available balance, recent charges, usage, and top-ups.
- Support tickets and alerts.

Lab Owner must not see:

- request fingerprint;
- dedup rows;
- raw runtime evidence;
- production readiness;
- manual settlement;
- raw Ledger events.

## Admin Surface

Admin sees:

- users and disabled status;
- roles and ownership;
- manual recharge;
- wallet transaction history;
- manual top-up audit;
- runtime and production readiness;
- Fabric resource catalog internals;
- raw Ledger evidence;
- support queue.

## Resource Creation

Creation flow:

1. Select package and open one dedicated CVM ComputeAllocation from its ComputePool.
2. Open or select a StorageVolume.
3. Attach the StorageVolume to the ComputeAllocation.
4. Create the Workspace URL entry.

Confirm shows:

- compute hourly price;
- storage price;
- seven-day hold;
- current balance;
- frozen balance;
- available balance;
- provisioning status and whether the Workspace URL can be opened.

## Billing Explanation

Billing UI explains wallet state, holds, recent debits, usage, and top-ups.

Raw ledger and dedup internals are not primary Lab Owner UI.
