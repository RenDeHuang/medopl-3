# OPL Console Workspace Product V2

## User Job

```text
sign in -> select Basic or Pro -> confirm one Workspace total -> provision
        -> reveal/copy access -> open Workspace
```

The invite-only Pilot has one primary Workspace per account. Home, Login, and
Logo/brand entry points remain unchanged; V2 does not redesign public Home or
Login surfaces.

## Owner Surface

Console shows:

- live Sub2API USD balance;
- fixed Basic or Pro Workspace package price in USD;
- general Gateway Key create, enable/disable, delete, reveal/copy, and per-Key
  Usage readback;
- resource status, `paidThrough`, auto-renew, and manual-review state;
- Workspace access, billing receipts, announcements, support, and account
  settings.

The Workspace access area answers, in one place and from owner readback: URL,
用户名, 密码 reveal/copy, and the corresponding Workspace Key reveal/copy. The
Workspace Key reuses `POST /api/gateway/keys/{keyId}/reveal`; it does not create a
second secret store or Key API. The public API origin comes only from
`OPL_GATEWAY_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`; invalid or missing production HTTPS configuration
is shown as unavailable.

Console does not show raw request fingerprints, provider credentials, generic
Fabric/Ledger APIs, or Sub2API admin operations.

## Admin Surface

Operations sees account mappings, roles, wallet recharge/debit/business refund,
receipt and review evidence, reconciliation reports, readiness, announcements,
and explicit cleanup operations. Resource rows show owner account/user,
Workspace, resource type, package/spec, provider ID, Zone, status, created and
expiry times, last readback, and operation/Receipt references. A missing owner
source displays unavailable; Fabric or Ledger facts are not copied into a new
Control Plane truth table.

## Purchase Confirmation

Workspace confirmation shows the selected package/spec, exact total USD charge,
current balance, entitlement period, and the compute/storage fulfillment included
in that total.

The operation is resumable. Provider preparation failure makes no charge.
Insufficient balance cleans the prepared resource. Ambiguous external results
enter manual review. Confirmed single charge activates the Workspace after
fulfillment and emits one purchase Receipt. Compute and storage never debit the
customer independently.

## Workspace And Storage

A Workspace is a stable URL backed by one StorageVolume and the current runtime
pointer. Compute can be replaced without changing the Workspace URL or deleting
storage. Storage deletion is explicit and irreversible.

## Evidence Levels

Contract/UI presence is not availability. `code-complete` requires the complete
local gate, `pilot-ready` requires approved real Pilot evidence, and
`production-proven` requires evidence from the deployed immutable revision.
