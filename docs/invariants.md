# Launch Invariants

This file is the mandatory human-readable launch contract for this implementation repository. The target product boundaries come from `https://github.com/gaofeng21cn/one-person-lab-cloud`; the revision reviewed for this freeze is `c349a41d860e706ed43a4090b9e75abb0b130971`.

The upstream repository owns product architecture. This repository owns its selected backend, exact prices, provider procurement, delivery state, and runtime evidence. A frozen target is not a readiness claim. Current gaps and required evidence are recorded here and in `packages/contracts/opl-cloud-launch-freeze-contract.json`.

## Product Surfaces And Owner Lanes

The five product surfaces are OPL Gateway, OPL Workspace, OPL Console, OPL Fabric, and OPL Ledger. Workspace is the product delivered by Fabric after it opens CVM and CBS and deploys the pinned `one-person-lab-app` image; it is not a fifth service repository.

The four implementation owner lanes are Console/Control Plane, Fabric, Gateway integration, and Ledger. Gateway integration is an adapter to the externally deployed Sub2API, never a second Gateway service.

## Pilot Scope

- The first cohort is 2-5 invited customer accounts; public registration is forbidden.
- One Console User maps to one OPL Account and one Sub2API User/Wallet. Console
  and Sub2API email must match after `lower(trim(email))`.
- Organization and Membership rows are internal one-to-one compatibility
  records only. They do not authorize sharing or appear in customer DTOs.
- Operators manually pre-fund or adjust the Sub2API wallet through audited
  recharge, debit, and business-refund commands. There is no customer payment,
  top-up, or payment-order surface. Owners may manage general API Keys.
- Each account has one Workspace. Basic and Pro are the only Pilot packages.
- `autoRenew` defaults off. Enabling it is rejected and hidden until a real
  renewal has been approved and proven.
- Backup, recovery, sync, transfer, HA, and multiple Workspaces are not Pilot
  capabilities.

## Console

- Console calls only Control Plane product APIs.
- Sub2API authenticates customer credentials. Control Plane owns local Sessions,
  account mapping, quotes, monthly orchestration, entitlements, expiry, and
  operator review; it stores no second customer password truth.
- Operators invite customers through `POST /api/operator/accounts/invitations`. The backend resolves or
  creates the Sub2API identity by normalized email and atomically stores the
  one-to-one local graph. Self-registration and SSO are not Pilot claims.
- Console displays live Sub2API balance, Key metadata, request usage, usage stats, and Ledger billing receipts without creating a wallet, Key database, usage database, or billing fact table.
- Basic is `2c4g` plus 10GB for `52_580_000` USD micros/month:
  `50_000_000` compute plus `2_580_000` storage.
- Pro is `8c16g` plus 100GB for `240_080_000` USD micros/month:
  `214_280_000` compute plus `25_800_000` storage.
- Basic and Pro are the target Pilot packages. A customer catalog entry becomes
  available only from matching live Fabric availability and after the production
  evidence gate passes.
- Internal Acceptance slots are not customer products and never appear in
  catalog or quote paths. Static package definitions are targets; actual
  availability comes from live Fabric catalog readback.

## Fabric

- Fabric is the only Tencent Cloud and Kubernetes writer.
- Customer and verification CVM/CBS procurement uses `PREPAID`, period 1 month, and `NOTIFY_AND_MANUAL_RENEW`.
- `POSTPAID_BY_HOUR` is forbidden for customer and verification CVM/CBS resources.
- Capacity and price preflight is read-only and happens before debit. It cannot buy, reserve, renew, or delete a Tencent resource.
- Fabric creates CBS with a stable `ClientToken`, reads back CVM/CBS identity and billing facts, then binds CBS through a static PV/PVC in the compute Zone.
- Static CBS uses `com.tencent.cloud.csi.cbs`, `volumeHandle=disk-*`, RWO, empty `storageClassName`, Zone affinity, and `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy=Retain`.
- `UNATTACHED` or `ATTACHED` is provider-ready; PVC `Bound` is required before Workspace deployment.
- Fabric owns provider facts and never changes Sub2API balance or Control Plane entitlement state.

## Ledger

- Ledger records append-only debit, refund, fulfillment, claim, activation, renewal, expiry, review, and verification evidence.
- Ledger never owns or changes spendable balance.
- Customer billing history is read live from Ledger through an account-scoped paginated query and projected through a strict allowlist; Control Plane never copies receipt facts.
- Operator reconciliation is computed by Control Plane from active billing operations, Sub2API balance history, Fabric provider operations, and Ledger receipts. Ledger appends the deterministic exception-only report; Control Plane stores only the latest purchase guard and never repairs money, provider resources, or receipts automatically.
- Receipts contain stable account, Workspace, billing-operation, provider-operation, resource, pricing, period, and redacted Gateway request references.
- `workspace.access_token_reset` uses the stable Runtime credential-rotation identity and records only owner, Runtime, resource, Secret-reference, and credential-version metadata.
- API keys, passwords, raw tokens, provider secrets, and raw Sub2API responses are forbidden in evidence.
- A missing receipt retries only the receipt and never repeats debit, refund, provider purchase, Secret write, or renewal.

## Gateway

- OPL Gateway uses the externally deployed Sub2API backend. Compatibility is gated by required API capabilities; the reported version is diagnostic metadata and never blocks an otherwise compatible deployment. Sub2API code, image, container, database, configuration, and deployment remain immutable from this repository.
- Sub2API is the only owner of spendable USD balance, API keys, model routing, and request usage.
- Control Plane maps the signed-in account through `sub2apiUserId`. Owners may manage general Keys; Workspace
  convergence separately requires exactly one active reserved Key named `opl-workspace` and fails closed otherwise.
- Required read capabilities are mapped-user balance, the mapped user's paginated Key list, paginated request usage, and aggregate usage stats. Request usage and stats are scoped by both `user_id` and the selected `api_key_id`; every returned identity is validated again by Control Plane.
- Request charges use Sub2API `actual_cost`, converted once to integer USD micros. Control Plane returns an explicit unavailable state for a missing capability or upstream failure and never substitutes zero.
- Control Plane decodes a strict customer-safe DTO allowlist. Raw Sub2API admin responses, nested raw Keys, upstream account internals, prompts, and response content never reach Console, OPL PostgreSQL, Ledger, logs, or caches.
- Key DTO fields `quota_used`, `usage_5h`, `usage_1d`, `usage_7d`, and `last_used_at` remain quota and recent-window signals; they do not replace request-level usage and aggregate stats.
- The owner may request an owned Key only through audited
  `POST /api/gateway/keys/{keyId}/reveal`. It is masked by default and
  never enters `/api/state`, browser storage, OPL PostgreSQL, Ledger, logs,
  caches, or operation payloads. The retired Gateway summary route is a 404.
- Kubernetes Secret is the only authorized Key persistence point. Fabric writes or rotates an account-scoped Secret, and Workspace runtime receives only its reference.
- The global `OPL_CODEX_API_KEY` is forbidden for customer Workspaces.
- The public API address comes only from `OPL_GATEWAY_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` through
  `GET /api/gateway/endpoint`. Production requires HTTPS; missing/invalid configuration is unavailable.
  Browser responses never expose or fall back to `OPL_SUB2API_BASE_URL` or `gflabtoken.cn`.

Every Console source projection carries `source`, `status`, `available`, and
`fetchedAt`. `empty` means a successful authoritative read with zero rows;
`unavailable` means the dependency failed and must not include fallback data,
zero values, empty collections, or a success state. `sourceUpdatedAt` is omitted
unless the authority supplies it. Identity scope comes only from the current
Session; browser `accountId`, `user_id`, and `api_key_id` inputs are ignored.

## Monthly Settlement

The approved purchase protocol does not depend on a generic hold/capture API. It uses the verified deterministic Redeem Code and Idempotency-Key path:

```text
validate account and quote
-> read-only provider capacity and price preflight
-> confirm live Sub2API balance
-> debit exact monthly amount
-> provision one-month PREPAID CVM and CBS
-> claim and read back all provider resources
-> activate compute and storage entitlements
-> record receipts
```

- Debit, provider mutation, claim, activation, refund, Secret write, renewal, and receipt each use stable operation-scoped identities.
- One authenticated `POST /api/workspace-launches` stores a durable
  `workspace.launch.v2` RuntimeOperation. Current V2 recovery resumes the stable
  total-debit, pure Fabric fulfillment, activation, and receipt sub-operations
  after browser close or process restart through `succeeded` or `refunded`.
- The submission-time Sub2API total-balance read is a read-only preflight, not a hold or reservation. One
  Workspace operation performs one deterministic total debit; compute and storage are fulfillment-only phases.
- Debit failure forbids every Tencent resource write.
- A confirmed provider result showing no billable resource exists permits exactly one idempotent refund.
- A partial or unknown provider result enters `manual_review` without refund or a second purchase.
- A Ledger failure after activation leaves the entitlement active and retries only its receipt.
- Replays never create a second debit, refund, purchase, renewal, Secret, or receipt.
- The current V2 implementation is code-complete in local tests from debit before
  provider mutation through pure Fabric compute/storage fulfillment, attachment,
  Gateway Secret, Runtime readiness, Workspace activation, and one
  `billing.workspace_purchased.v1` or `billing.workspace_refunded.v1` Receipt.
  No real Sub2API, Tencent, Runtime, browser, or production evidence is claimed.
  S9 remains blocked on the external Runtime metadata/statfs API and new immutable image.

## Products And Lifecycle

- Workspace is the customer subscription and owns the canonical renewal intent,
  price snapshot, period, paid-through value, and renewal status. Compute and
  storage rows are provider and compatibility facts.
- Customer prices are fixed integer USD micros under
  `pilot-usd-2026-07-v1`; provider costs never derive a customer charge.
- Provider SKU may vary by approved environment but must satisfy the customer CPU and memory contract.
- One Workspace renewal uses one combined Sub2API debit, manual provider renewal
  of the same CVM/CBS, readback, entitlement extension, and one receipt.
- Tencent automatic renewal is forbidden.
- At unpaid expiry compute is stopped and access is denied. CBS is retained;
  expiry, release, QA, and rollback never delete it.
- Workspace file bodies live only on CBS. OPL PostgreSQL and Ledger never store
  them, and OPL provides no backup/recovery/sync/transfer guarantee for deleted
  or corrupted CBS data.

## Workspace Access And Secrets

- Workspace URLs are stable and require Runtime password login.
- A routing cookie selects a Runtime Service and is not an authentication credential.
- Ordinary Runtime status is non-secret and never returns a password or Kubernetes Secret reference.
- Only the signed-in user whose ID equals `Workspace.ownerUserId` may reveal or rotate the Runtime password. These responses are `private, no-store`; the password never enters Workspace persistence, RuntimeOperation, audit, logs, or Ledger.
- Runtime credential rotation reuses stable Fabric and Ledger idempotency identities. A credential revision changes the Runtime Secret and Pod template so Kubernetes rolls the Deployment without exposing the password or seed in metadata.
- Pilot Runtime isolation means only the owner receives the Runtime password. SSO and binding each Runtime HTTP request to the Console identity are not Pilot claims.
- Workspace access requires active compute and storage entitlements plus real runtime readiness.
- The pinned source image is `ghcr.io/gaofeng21cn/one-person-lab-webui:26.7.13@sha256:9d867fe0fc9db48b6efa27371d77770e46fc8cd97d26ef85a81fbdac7e96ca76`.
- Production mirrors that source to TCR and deploys the target `repository@sha256`; `latest` and tag-only production references are forbidden.
- CBS is mounted at `/data` and `/projects`.
- Runtime is the only authority for `/projects` file metadata and mounted filesystem usage. These read-only facts
  are streamed through Fabric and Control Plane and are never persisted in OPL PostgreSQL or Ledger.

## Console User Experience

- Authentication, lazy-route loading, and account-state loading have distinct timeout, error, and retry states.
- Public and login routes render immediately; a session check may enrich or redirect them but never gates their first interactive screen.
- The first authenticated screen answers live wallet status, Workspace
  usability, current server-projected price/period, AI actual spend, receipts,
  and actionable failures.
- Billing history is a tenant-scoped projection of Ledger receipts. Gateway request history and totals are tenant-scoped projections of live Sub2API usage APIs. Neither projection persists a second copy of the facts.
- Balance, entitlements, billing receipts, and Gateway usage load independently. One unavailable source cannot hold the whole Console in a spinner or erase facts from another source.
- The primary flow is one recoverable Workspace launch covering package,
  server-projected total price, debit, PREPAID resources, Gateway Secret,
  Runtime, and URL. Compute/storage are Workspace details, not separate buys.
- Workspace status polls every 10 seconds for at most 30 attempts, stops on ready or terminal state, and offers manual retry after a real error or timeout.
- Gateway fetches only when its page is opened, masks the Key by default, supports explicit reveal/copy, and clears sensitive response state on route leave or logout.
- Workspace answers URL, username, password reveal/copy, and the corresponding Workspace Key reveal/copy;
  Workspace Key reveal reuses the owned per-Key Gateway route.
- Control Plane owns the two-table minimal Pilot announcement and read state; it does not copy Sub2API notices.
- Desktop and mobile QA must prove responsive layout, keyboard access, error recovery, and no sensitive-information overlap or leakage.

The existing public Home, Login, and Logo/brand entry remain unchanged in Pilot V2.

## Evidence Levels

- `code-complete` requires current contracts, code, local PostgreSQL, browser, structure, and machine-checked
  zero-SKIP gates on one integration HEAD.
- `pilot-ready` additionally requires separately approved real Gateway, Runtime, Tencent, billing, and browser evidence.
- `production-proven` additionally requires the same immutable revision deployed and read back in production.

`sourceUpdatedAt` is returned only when the authoritative owner supplies it. Final Go gates parse `go test -json`
and fail on `Action=skip`; PostgreSQL suites set `OPL_POSTGRES_TESTS=1`, and a Control Plane zero-SKIP claim also
sets `OPL_CAPACITY_TESTS=1`.

## Verification Slot

Provider Acceptance owns two retained non-customer slots:

| Slot | Package | CVM | CBS | Provider billing |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `verification-slot-basic-01` | Basic | `SA5.MEDIUM4` (`2c4g`) | 10GB | `PREPAID`, one month, manual renew |
| `verification-slot-pro-01` | Pro | `SA5.2XLARGE16` (`8c16g`) | 100GB | `PREPAID`, one month, manual renew |

- Lifetime purchase budget is one per slot. Read-only inventory runs first;
  multiple or ambiguous candidates stop without purchase.
- Provider Acceptance is a separate manually approved workflow and has not been
  run for the current candidate.
- Ordinary deployment requires both slots but performs no purchase, renewal, or
  deletion. Release live QA uses one Basic reserved account, one dedicated Key,
  and one model request for the entire release.
- Live QA must prove exact-one Usage (`keyId`, `requestId`, model, endpoint,
  Tokens, `actualCostUsdMicros`), an equal wallet balance delta, the same Ledger
  Receipt/CVM/CBS/RuntimeOperation facts, Ready Pod `imageID`, login/WebSocket,
  and zero Tencent mutation.
- This verification chain is code-complete and fake-tested, not
  production-proven. Real execution requires explicit approval.

## Launch Stages

## Delivery Phases

The six delivery phases are: contract and cleanup; Fabric PREPAID and Workspace; Gateway account projection; commercial plans and settlement; Console UX and release safety; integration, real verification, and rollout. These phases organize four sessions and do not replace the ten business launch stages.

## Completion Rule

A launch stage is complete only when its human and machine contracts are current, focused and full tests pass, merged CI passes, exact image digests are deployed, and the listed runtime evidence is recorded. Documentation or a green fake alone never proves production delivery.
