# OPL Console Developer Guide

## Product Truth

OPL Console is the commercial control plane. The current resource model is:

- `ComputePool`: package-level Tencent TKE node pool for one fixed compute specification.
- `ComputeAllocation`: account-owned dedicated CVM node inside one ComputePool for one-person-lab-app.
- `StorageVolume`: account-owned retained PVC/cloud storage.
- `StorageAttachment`: a storage volume mounted to a ComputeAllocation at a mount path such as `/data`.
- `Workspace`: URL token and WebUI entry composed from an attached compute allocation/storage pair.
- `Wallet` and `Ledger`: billing records reference `computeAllocationId`, `computePoolId`, `storageVolumeId`, `storageAttachmentId`, and `workspaceId`.

Workspace is not the only resource body. It is the access entry.

## Runtime Modes

OPL Console has three supported operator modes:

- `local-demo`: local UI preview with `local-docker`; never mutates Tencent Cloud.
- `local-to-staging`: local Console API/UI connected to staging PostgreSQL and staging TKE; can create real Tencent resources after explicit operator confirmation.
- `cloud-staging`: deployed Console in TKE using the same staging PostgreSQL and resource pool; validates rollout, ingress, TLS, image, and secret wiring.

The code path is shared. The difference is environment and persistence. `local-to-staging` and `cloud-staging` must use the same `DATABASE_URL` so accounts, balances, resources, ledger rows, and Workspace URLs are one system.

## Local UI Demo

```bash
npm run demo:api
npm run demo:ui
```

Default demo accounts:

- Lab Owner: `owner@opl.local` / `OplOwnerPass2026!`
- Admin: `admin@opl.local` / `OplAdminPass2026!`

Local demo seeds the current chain: manual top-up, create compute allocation, create storage, attach storage, create Workspace URL, record one sub2api request usage, and create one support ticket.

`demo:api` is local-only and refuses `OPL_RUNTIME_PROVIDER=tencent-tke`. Use it for UI/UX review, not cloud resource testing.

## Local To Staging

```bash
cp deploy/tke/opl-cloud-staging.local.env.example .env.staging.local
npm run staging:readiness
npm run staging:local
npm run staging:ui
```

`staging:local` loads the ignored `.env.staging.local`, builds the Go Tencent provisioner, requires `OPL_RUNTIME_PROVIDER=tencent-tke`, and uses staging PostgreSQL. It does not reset state or seed demo users.

Run real local-to-staging E2E only after readiness passes and you intend to create billable Tencent Cloud resources:

```bash
OPL_CONFIRM_REAL_CLOUD_E2E=1 npm run staging:e2e
```

This verifier may use a local Console origin such as `http://127.0.0.1:8787`, but the Workspace URL still must be a public HTTPS staging URL.

## Cloud Staging E2E

After rollout, run the public verifier against the deployed Console. Both Console and Workspace URLs must be public HTTPS URLs.

Expected chain:

1. Login.
2. Verify or top up wallet balance.
3. Create compute allocation from the selected package pool.
4. Create storage.
5. Attach storage to compute.
6. Create Workspace URL.
7. Poll runtime status for the dedicated CVM node, Deployment, PVC, Service, Ingress, and Endpoints.
8. Open the public Workspace URL and receive HTTP 200 from one-person-lab-app.
9. Record sub2api/request usage.
10. Verify wallet, ledger, usage logs, and runtime evidence.
11. Detach and destroy resources.

Run after staging is configured:

```bash
npm run validate:production-manifest
OPL_CONSOLE_ORIGIN=https://<console-domain> npm run verify:production
```

Rollout confidence gate:

```text
unit/contract tests pass
+ local-to-staging readiness pass
+ local-to-staging real E2E pass
+ cloud-staging readiness pass
+ cloud-staging public E2E pass
= ready to consider public launch
```

## Required Env Vars

- `OPL_RUNTIME_PROVIDER`: `local-docker` or `tencent-tke`.
- `OPL_WORKSPACE_IMAGE`: pullable one-person-lab-app image.
- `OPL_WORKSPACE_DOMAIN`: public Workspace domain.
- `OPL_K8S_NAMESPACE`: Kubernetes namespace.
- `OPL_INGRESS_CLASS`: ingress class.
- `OPL_WORKSPACE_STORAGE_CLASS`: PVC storage class.
- `OPL_IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_NAME`: image pull secret.
- `TENCENT_DEPLOY_KUBECONFIG_REF`: kubeconfig path.
- `OPL_TENCENT_PROVISIONER_BIN`: local Go SDK provisioner binary used for Tencent Cloud mutations.
- `DATABASE_URL`: required for durable shared staging state.

## Route Contract Rules

- `packages/contracts/opl-cloud-route-api-contract.json` contains only current commercial truth.
- Future routes live in route backlog or product docs, not active contract.
- Every enabled UI route must have a stable route id and routeTo path.
- Every implemented route must bind page module, API client, server route, permission, object kind, and service boundary.
- Lab Owner routes do not expose operator/Fabric/Ledger raw evidence.

## Compute Storage Billing Semantics

- Creating a ComputeAllocation starts compute billing and reserves a compute hold.
- Creating storage starts storage billing and reserves a storage hold.
- Attaching storage does not create a new priced resource; it records the mount relationship.
- Workspace entry creates a URL token for an existing attachment.
- Stopping compute is not a commercial owner action in the current model. A dedicated CVM remains billable until the ComputeAllocation is destroyed.

## Pre-Commit Checklist

```bash
node --test tests/contracts/route-api-contract.test.js
node --test tests/domain/resource-provisioning.test.js
node --test tests/providers/tencent-tke-provider.test.js tests/providers/local-docker-provider.test.js
node --test tests/ui/commercial-console-routes.test.js tests/ui/commercial-console-surface.test.js tests/ui/console-clickability-contract.test.js
npm run build
git diff --check
```

## Common Failures

- Image pull denied: make `OPL_WORKSPACE_IMAGE` pullable and verify `OPL_IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_NAME`.
- Localhost Workspace URL: staging e2e must use a public `OPL_WORKSPACE_DOMAIN`.
- Missing storage class: set `OPL_WORKSPACE_STORAGE_CLASS` to an available class.
- Ingress path not routing: check shared Ingress class and `/w/<workspaceId>` path.
- Leftover cloud resources: detach storage, destroy compute allocation, then destroy storage.
