# OPL Cloud

OPL Cloud is the online hosted version of OPL.

This repository is the OPL Cloud implementation workspace for the OPL Console and OPL Workspace control-plane flow.

Implementation scope is fixed in [docs/project.md](./docs/project.md): [`one-person-lab`](https://github.com/gaofeng21cn/one-person-lab) provides the development framework concepts and lifecycle rules, [`one-person-lab-cloud`](https://github.com/gaofeng21cn/one-person-lab-cloud) provides the Cloud product definition, and this repository implements the OPL Console / OPL Workspace control-plane slice.

The implementation is staged for future extraction under [packages](./packages): `console`, `fabric`, `ledger`, and `contracts`.

## Product Names

- `OPL Cloud`: the external product name.
- `OPL Gateway`: the AI capability gateway, provider routing, and usage policy boundary owned by the Cloud product architecture.
- `OPL Console`: the management entry for opening workspaces, billing, access, and settings.
- `OPL Workspace`: the actual working environment delivered as a URL.
- `OPL Fabric`: the controlled compute and storage provisioning boundary.
- `OPL Ledger`: receipts, billing ledger, audit events, reconciliation, and verifier evidence.

Use only these OPL Cloud names in product copy, UI, and design documents.

## Confirmed Business Flow

```text
PI signs in to OPL Console
-> creates an OPL Workspace
-> chooses one of the default compute/storage packages
-> confirms hourly billing and 7-day compute plus storage pre-freeze
-> OPL Cloud creates one runtime compute unit
-> OPL Cloud creates one persistent workspace storage volume
-> OPL Cloud deploys one one-person-lab-app Docker container
-> OPL Cloud mounts persistent storage into the Docker runtime
-> OPL Cloud creates a stable workspace URL with a permanent token
-> OPL Console shows the URL
-> PI copies and shares the URL
-> members open the URL and enter the OPL Workspace without login
```

## Core Resource Mapping

```text
1 OPL Workspace
= 1 runtime compute unit
= 1 one-person-lab-app Docker container
= 1 persistent workspace storage volume
= 1 URL
```

One PI account can own multiple OPL Workspaces.

## Critical Lifecycle Rule

Compute and persistent storage lifecycles are separate.

Stopping or destroying compute must not destroy persistent storage. Storage is destroyed only after an explicit user confirmation. Storage billing continues until storage destruction completes.

## Access Rule

Workspace URLs use:

```text
https://workspace.medopl.cn/w/<workspaceId>?token=<share-token>
```

The token is permanent until the owner deletes or resets it. Opening the URL does not require login.

## Default Packages

| Package | Compute | Persistent storage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Basic Workspace | 2 CPU / 4GB | 10GB |
| Pro Workspace | 8 CPU / 16GB | 100GB |

GPU Workspaces are outside the current production package list. They require a verified GPU node pool before becoming a product package.

## Billing Rule

Billing is hourly. The user-facing price is Tencent Cloud resource cost plus a 20% platform markup.

Compute and storage must not operate unpaid. OPL Cloud freezes enough balance for 7 days of compute and persistent storage before opening or resuming a Workspace. Opening a Workspace charges the first hour immediately from available balance. Later settlements round up to full hours and charge available balance first, then the relevant frozen hold. If available balance is exhausted, OPL Cloud records a notification. If compute hold is exhausted, OPL Cloud stops compute and notifies the operator. Storage hold exhaustion freezes the Workspace state until the user adds balance or explicitly destroys storage.

## Product Design

See [docs/product/console-workspace-v1.md](./docs/product/console-workspace-v1.md) for the current OPL Console commercial workspace product design.

For the current launch boundary, use [docs/status.md](./docs/status.md). The current status is controlled commercial pilot readiness for CPU Workspaces, not public GA.

## Current Implementation

The current app implements the local business-chain loop with the Local Docker provider:

- OPL Console UI
- Basic and Pro CPU Workspace creation
- permanent workspace URL token
- compute stop/restart/destroy controls
- disk destroy with explicit confirmation
- 7-day compute and storage prepaid holds
- Local Docker Compose workspace artifacts under `.runtime/workspaces`
- real OPL Workspace app image default: `ghcr.io/gaofeng21cn/one-person-lab-app:latest`
- bind-mounted Workspace disk paths mapped to `/data` and `/projects`
- Workspace URL route with token validation
- optional real local Docker execution with `OPL_LOCAL_DOCKER_EXECUTE=1`
- hourly billing settlement endpoint
- billing ledger
- audit receipts

Production runtime readiness is exposed at:

```text
GET /api/runtime/readiness
```

The Console also shows readiness at the top of the page so real cloud creation is not attempted blindly.

Production launch readiness is exposed at:

```text
GET /api/production/readiness
```

It checks the Tencent TKE production runtime provider, TCR images, workspace domain, PostgreSQL, Tencent environment, and required host tools before launch.

## Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run build
PORT=8787 npm start
```

By default, local development uses an ignored JSON state file under `.runtime/`.
For PostgreSQL control-plane persistence, set:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://opl:secret@127.0.0.1:5432/opl_cloud \
PORT=8787 npm start
```

When `DATABASE_URL` is set, OPL Console stores login users, account balances, Workspaces, billing ledger entries, audit events, and runtime operation scaffolding in PostgreSQL tables. `OPL_CONSOLE_USERS_JSON` is only the bootstrap seed for the first PI/admin login users; after those users are written to the control-plane store, account status, roles, ownership, balances, Workspaces, billing, and audit records persist with the database across Console rollouts.

OPL Ledger is the v1 billing truth. External metering systems are not required for production billing.

```bash
OPL_BILLING_MARKUP=0.2 \
OPL_BASIC_COMPUTE_HOURLY_CNY=0.39 \
OPL_PRO_COMPUTE_HOURLY_CNY=3.09 \
OPL_STORAGE_GB_MONTH_CNY=0.36 \
PORT=8787 npm start
```

OPL Console remains the v1 billing ledger and user-facing balance source.

To reconcile OPL ledger debits against normalized Tencent Cloud bill totals from a deployed OPL Console:

```bash
npm run reconcile:tencent -- \
  --console-origin https://<console-domain> \
  --account <pi-account-id> \
  --tencent tencent-bills.json
```

The command reads:

- OPL `compute_debit` / `storage_debit` ledger entries from `GET /api/state?accountId=<pi-account-id>`
- Tencent bill rows from the provided local export file

For offline reconciliation against a saved OPL ledger export:

```bash
npm run reconcile:tencent -- --ledger ledger.json --tencent tencent-bills.json
```

Tencent bill rows should be normalized as:

```json
{ "workspaceId": "ws-alpha", "resourceType": "server", "amount": 10, "currency": "CNY" }
```

For raw Tencent billing export rows, include the Workspace identity as a `workspace_id` tag and run:

```bash
npm run reconcile:tencent -- --ledger ledger.json --tencent tencent-export.json --tencent-format raw
```

It compares Tencent cost plus the configured 20% markup against OPL ledger debits and exits non-zero on mismatch. It writes JSON to stdout only and should not leave deployment or smoke artifacts in the repository.

To also start the local OPL Docker container when a Workspace is created:

```bash
OPL_LOCAL_DOCKER_EXECUTE=1 \
OPL_WORKSPACE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/gaofeng21cn/one-person-lab-app:latest \
PORT=8787 npm start
```

For development UI:

```bash
npm start
npm run dev
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

## Production Deployment Contract

Production deployment uses Tencent TKE only. Inject this repo's environment variables from your secret manager:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Do not copy secret files from older projects into this repository. Use `.env.example` as the variable contract and provide real values through local shell env, CI secrets, or a deployment secret manager.

For deployment handoff, keep real secrets outside git and validate the secret-reference manifest:

```bash
npm run validate:production-manifest -- --manifest deploy/production-manifest.example.json
```

The manifest format requires sensitive values to use `secretRef`, not inline plaintext.

Run the Console with `OPL_RUNTIME_PROVIDER=tencent-tke`, TCR image refs, a kubeconfig reference, namespace, Ingress class, image pull Secret, and Workspace storage class. Each Workspace maps to a Deployment, Service, Ingress path, token Secret, and retained PVC. Compute lifecycle actions intentionally retain the PVC; storage deletion is a separate explicit action.

## Production Verification

After deploying OPL Console to Tencent TKE with PostgreSQL, TCR images, TLS, DNS, and HTTPS readiness configured, run the real chain verifier from an operator shell only after explicit approval:

```bash
OPL_CONSOLE_ORIGIN=https://<console-domain> npm run verify:production
```

The verifier is fail-closed. It first checks:

- `GET /api/production/readiness`
- `GET /api/runtime/readiness`

Only when both are ready does it create a real verification Workspace and exercise:

```text
credit account
create Workspace
verify TKE runtime status for Deployment/PVC/Service/Ingress/Endpoints
open Workspace URL
stop runtime compute while retaining workspace storage
restart runtime compute
destroy runtime compute while retaining workspace storage
recreate runtime compute from retained workspace storage
open the same Workspace URL again after recreation
settle internal ledger billing
destroy verification runtime compute
destroy verification workspace storage
```

This command creates billable Tencent Cloud runtime resources and lifecycle events, then attempts to clean up the verification compute and storage on both success and post-creation failure paths. By default, the Workspace name and verification ledger source events include a unique run id so repeated verification runs create fresh cloud resources and remain traceable in billing records. Use a dedicated verification account. Successful runs write structured JSON to stdout; failed runs write structured JSON to stderr, including `cleanupErrors` when cleanup does not fully complete. If the verifier reports cleanup errors, inspect OPL Console and Tencent Cloud and explicitly destroy any remaining verification resources. The command writes no smoke report or generated artifact into the repository.

Optional verifier controls:

```bash
OPL_VERIFY_ACCOUNT_ID=pi-production-verifier
OPL_VERIFY_RUN_ID=20260701-preprod-a
OPL_VERIFY_WORKSPACE_NAME="Production Verification Lab"
OPL_VERIFY_PACKAGE_ID=basic
OPL_VERIFY_CREDIT_AMOUNT=1000
OPL_VERIFY_URL_ATTEMPTS=12
OPL_VERIFY_RETRY_DELAY_MS=5000
```

## OPL WebUI Runtime Boundary

OPL Cloud references the One Person Lab repositories only as runtime contracts. `one-person-lab` owns the framework/CLI layer; `one-person-lab-app` owns the Docker/WebUI product entry that OPL Cloud deploys as one Workspace container.

The `one-person-lab-app` Docker/WebUI runtime exposes port `3000` and must persist two mounted paths:

- `/data`: WebUI internal state, configuration, sessions, maintenance logs, and caches.
- `/projects`: long-lived project files and Workspace deliverables.

The current production templates set:

```text
ALLOW_REMOTE=true
DATA_DIR=/data
AIONUI_DATA_DIR=/data
OPL_PROJECTS_DIR=/projects
OPL_WEBUI_AUTH_MODE=none
HOME=/data
OPL_WORKSPACE_ROOT=/projects
CODEX_HOME=/data/codex
```

API keys and model credentials must not be injected through CLI arguments, environment variables, or Docker Compose. They are entered inside the WebUI after the Workspace URL is opened.

No-auth mode is acceptable only because OPL Cloud owns the Workspace URL token boundary. Do not expose the container directly without the OPL Workspace URL/token gateway or another trusted proxy boundary.
